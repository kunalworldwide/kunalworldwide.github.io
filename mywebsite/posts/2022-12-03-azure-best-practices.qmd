Azure best practices assist businesses in making the most of Azure resources to create and maintain scalable, cost-efficient, and secure solutions on the Microsoft Azure cloud. Having the correct Azure best practices can make or ruin a firm because Azure serves as the foundation of many modern organizations. I’ve covered the fundamental best practices that every Azure administrator needs to be aware of in this document. I’ve also provided advice on how to create a secure, reliable, and effective Azure infrastructure. These best practices must be followed in tandem because none of them by themselves can adequately secure the systems. You must select the best security alternatives based on your surroundings and demands, as is always the case.

## Security:

the most important thing before anything else is security, The recommendations below can help assure more robust Azure security, but they cannot serve as a complete substitute. The top practices that I believe will help you strengthen and safeguard your Azure are listed below.

## Enable Azure AD Conditional Access and enforce MFA

Azure AD Conditional Access assists administrators in enabling users to be productive whenever and wherever they choose while simultaneously safeguarding the assets of the company. Automating access control based on security, business, and compliance requirements are made possible via conditional access. Access to data and applications is protected by the addition of a crucial security layer provided by Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication. To design an Azure Active Directory conditional access deployment and evaluate deployment considerations for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication, go to these Azure documentation sites (MFA).

## Disable RDP/SSH from the Internet

Use JIT and Azure Bastion Do not expose RDP and SSH access over the Internet in order to provide remote access to Windows and Linux VMs in Azure from anywhere in the world without compromising security. To provide safe remote access to Azure virtual machines, use one of these techniques:

✓ **Enable site-to-site VPN or ExpressRoute connections for Just-In-Time (JIT) VM access:**

JIT offers time-limited VM access through RDP and SSH, which lessens the exposure to brute force assaults. In essence, Network Security Groups (NSGs) lock off RDP and SSH ports and only permit authorized users to access them for a predetermined time. Users can request access to JIT VMs using Azure AD and role-based Access Control (RBAC) permissions.

**✓ Configure Azure Bastion inside your virtual network.**

Direct RDP/SSH communication to your VMs over TLS from the Azure interface is made possible by Azure Bastion. The PaaS service Azure Bastion does away with the requirement for VMs to have public IP addresses, agents, or specialized client software.

**Secure privileged access with Azure AD PIM**

Azure AD Privileged Identity Management enables management, control, and monitoring of access to vital resources in Azure, Microsoft 365, and Intune (PIM). Admins must activate or elevate their privilege through PIM in order to use it for a brief period of time.

## Management:

**Use Resource Groups; Tag individual resources:**

Create a resource group strategy that meets your company’s needs, then plan, create, and implement it. Resource groups, which are logical collections of Azure resources, containerize related resources in a group for administration simplicity, security, and cost tracking for your workloads.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*F7hE-TH6xttMSB9m2_wQWg.png)

A best practice resource group strategy should include the following: Group resources by

Environment: prod, dev, uat,stg,perf,sit

Application: BI,DWH

Business Unit: ML,DS

**Follow a well-defined naming standard**

Include resource type, application or business unit, environment, Azure region, and consecutive entity number etc.

For example, dev-ause-asy-01 means Azure Synapse Workspace in Australia South East Region which is in DEV environment.

**Leverage Resource tagging**

Tag all resources inside resource groups to communicate valuable information to your teams, discover resources, and manage costs and it is easy to delete resources as well.

## Operations:

**Use Azure Advisor:**

Azure Advisor offers individualised, practical advice for cost, security, dependability, operational excellence, and performance. Organizations can optimise their deployments with Azure Advisor in accordance with Microsoft best practises. These suggestions are based on Microsoft best practises that are successful for most businesses and were compiled using resource configuration analysis and usage telemetry in your Azure tenant.

## Cost Optimization:

**Use reserved instances:**

Reserved instances are useful in certain circumstances, such as when you frequently employ the same VM size across several VMs. Domain controllers operating on Azure are an excellent example. On these VMs, three-year reserved instances offer savings of up to 72%.

**Delete unneeded resources:**

After VMs are decommissioned, orphan resources are frequently forgotten about and left in a tenant. These resources are pricey! Common examples of these Azure orphan resources include network cards and OS discs. Fortunately, the Azure Portal assists in reminding administrators to delete unnecessary resources at provisioning and deletion time.

## Services:

In this section let us see in detail the most used resources and the best way to use those,

➢ Virtual Machine

✓ Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and complex passwords. MFA can help limit the threat of compromised credentials. Complex passwords help reduce the effectiveness of brute-force password attacks. ✓ Use just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine access. JIT access works with NSGs and the Azure firewall and helps you layer in role-based access controls (RBAC) and time-bindings on access to virtual machines.

✓ Have a patch process in place. If you’re not patching your workloads, all your other efforts may be for nothing. A single unpatched vulnerability can lead to a breach. A patch process to keep your operating systems and applications up to date helps you mitigate this risk.

✓ Lock down administrative ports. Unless necessary, restrict access to SSH, RDP, WinRM, and other administrative ports.

✓ Use the Azure firewall and network security groups (NGSs) to limit access to workloads. Consistent with the principle of least privilege, use NSGs and the Azure firewall to restrict workload access.

✓ Apply the Latest OS Patches Ensure that the latest OS patches available for Microsoft Azure virtual machines are applied.

✓ Approved Azure Machine Image in Use Ensure that all your Azure virtual machine instances are launched from approved machine images only.

✓ Enable Auto-Shutdown Configure your Microsoft Azure virtual machines to automatically shut down on a daily basis.

**➢ Storage**

✓ Restrict database and storage access. UseFirewalls and access controls to limit what level of access users, devices, and services have to your databases and storage blobs.

✓ Leverage auditing. Turn on auditing for your Azure databases. Doing so enables you to gain visibility into all database changes.

✓ Configure threat detection for Azure SQL. If you use Azure SQL, activating threat detection helps you identify security issues faster and limit dwell time.

✓ Set log alerts in Azure Monitor. It isn’t enough to simply log events. Make sure you are alerting against security-related events in Azure Monitor so you can remediate issues quickly (and automatically when possible).

✓ Enable Azure Defender for your storage accounts. Azure Defender provides you with hardening and securing your Azure storage accounts.

✓ Use soft deletes. Soft deletes help you ensure data is still retrievable (for 14 days) in the event a malicious actor (or user error) leads to data you wanted to keep — getting deleted.

✓ Use shared access signatures (SAS). SAS enables you to implement granular access controls and time limits on client access to data.

✓ Disable Anonymous Access to Blob Containers Ensure that anonymous access to blob containers is disabled within your Azure Storage account.

✓ Disable public access to storage accounts with blob containers Ensure that public access to blob containers is disabled for your Azure storage accounts to override any ACL configurations allowing access.

**➢ Network**

✓ Encrypt data in transit. As we mentioned in the encryption and data security section: encryption of data in transit (and at rest) is a must. Leverage modern encryption protocols for all network traffic.

✓ Implement zero trust. By default, network policies should deny access unless there is an explicit allow rule.

✓ Limit open ports and Internet-facing endpoints. Unless there is a well-defined business reason for a port to be open or workload to be Internet-facing, don’t let it happen.

✓ Monitor device access. Monitoring access to your workloads and devices (e.g. using a SIEM or Azure Monitor) helps you proactively detect threats

✓ Segment your networks. Logical network segmentation can help improve visibility, make your networks easier to manage and limit east-west movement in the event of a breach.

✓ Check for NSG Flow Log Retention Period Ensure that the Network Security Group (NSG) flow log retention period is greater than or equal to 90 days.

✓ Check for Network Security Groups with Port Ranges Ensure there are no network security groups with a range of ports opened to allow incoming traffic.
