## Project Overview
This project involves developing a lead scoring model for X Education to identify potential customers with a higher likelihood of conversion. The goal is to achieve a lead conversion rate of around 80%.

## Approach
The approach was divided into four key stages:

1. **Data Understanding and Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Model Building and Evaluation**

### Part 1: Data Understanding and Cleaning
- **Objective**: Understanding the dataset's structure and cleaning the data.
- **Tasks Performed**:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Dropping irrelevant columns.
  - Addressing data inconsistencies.

### Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective**: Gaining insights through visualizations and statistical summaries.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Importance of features like total visits, time spent on the website, and page views in predicting conversion.

### Part 3: Feature Engineering
- **Objective**: Enhancing the model's predictive power through feature transformation and creation.
- **Tasks Performed**:
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Scaling numerical features.
  - Handling outliers.
  - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Part 4: Model Building and Evaluation
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression.
- **Performance**:
  - Achieved an accuracy of approximately 79.05% on the test set.
  - Evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, precision, and the precision-recall curve.
  - Identified areas for improvement in recall.

## Key Learnings
- **Data Preprocessing**: Essential for accurate modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Crucial for understanding the dataset and feature selection.
- **Feature Engineering**: Significantly impacts model performance.
- **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Vital for achieving desired outcomes.
- **Interpretability and Explainability**: Important for providing actionable insights.
- **Precision-Recall Trade-off**: Aids in selecting an optimal threshold for the model.

## Conclusion
The project successfully developed a lead scoring model for X Education, employing a systematic approach and best practices in data preprocessing and modeling.
