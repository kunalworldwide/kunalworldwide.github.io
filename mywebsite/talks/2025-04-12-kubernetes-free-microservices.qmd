This talk explores how Azure Container Apps enables developers to build and deploy microservices without the operational complexity of managing Kubernetes clusters.

## Agenda

1. Challenges with Traditional Kubernetes Deployments
   - Infrastructure overhead
   - Management complexity
   - Learning curve challenges
   - Cost considerations

2. Introduction to Azure Container Apps
   - Architecture and design principles
   - Relationship to Kubernetes and KEDA
   - Built-in features and capabilities

3. Key Features and Benefits
   - Serverless containers with auto-scaling
   - Traffic management with revisions and ingress
   - Microservice patterns support
   - Built-in service discovery
   - Event-driven architecture support

4. Use Cases and Scenarios
   - API backends
   - Background processing
   - Event-driven microservices
   - Migration paths from Kubernetes

5. Deployment and Operations
   - CI/CD integration
   - Monitoring and observability
   - Security best practices
   - Cost optimization strategies

6. Live Demo: Building and Deploying Microservices
   - Setting up a multi-container application
   - Implementing auto-scaling
   - Managing traffic and revisions
   - Integration with other Azure services
