    "text": "Kunal Das, Author\nRead on :\nWell, when you want to design the build and release pipeline for any software development the one thing that comes to mind is where to do the whole operation.\napparently, There are two ways of doing it,\nThe free and easy way is to use a Microsoft Hosted build agent,\nBut in some cases, we may need to use a Self-hosted build agent,\nlet’s see what Microsoft has to say about self-hosted build agents.\nSo, Self-hosted build agents do provide some benefits, but in my experience, some of these benefits can be achieved in Microsoft-hosted build agents as well.\nFor instance, if you have a relatively small build/release pipeline there’s no need to cache dependencies as it may give you a faster build time but do you really need it?\nNow let’s see what a Microsoft hosted agent is as per them,\nSo as you can see these agents are ephemeral by nature so we can not use them for something permanent right?\nwell, yes but there are some other wat to look at it.\nIn this article, I have a solution for a different problem, which is using a self-hosted build agent to overcome firewall restrictions set in different azure resources.\nBut first, let’s understand the problem.\nFirewall restriction in a Synapse workspace\nIn the image, you can see public network access can be disabled. in that case, you will not be able to connect to this resource from the DevOps pipeline,\nIn some places, I have seen people using a self-hosted agent just for this purpose but actually, this is not required.\nThe process here is adding the IP address as a rule into the firewall\nand you can do just that from the CI/CD pipeline itself,\nLet’s look at how to achieve that.\nI am taking the example of Synapse,\nSo just before the deployment task add an Azure CLI task in the pipeline.\nand write the PowerShell script to add the build agent IP into the synapse workspace, needless to say, you need to give the service connection proper role to perform the action.\nIf you like to use Yaml then here is the code!\nNow, as we can add the firewall rule we can delete the rule too, for that use the below code\nand that is it.\nonce you run the deployment it will copy the IP to the build agent add it into the firewall rule then run the deployment and then delete it, but\nFeel free to reach me incase of any issues!!\nadios"

Here’s how you can do it:\nThat’s it! The Publish Build Artifacts task will publish the specified artifacts to the pipeline or file share you specified. You can then use the artifact in a release pipeline or download it from the Artifacts page in Azure DevOps.\nNow for any reason, you may want to get the same result from the release pipeline as well, but unfortunately, the PublishPipelineArtifact@1 task does not support in release pipeline and even if you run it you will get some error, to solve this you can do one thing,"

CI/CD in ADF context is the seamless transition of data pipelines across different environments like development, testing, and production. ADF leverages Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to encapsulate the configurations of its entities, such as pipelines, datasets, and data flows. There are primarily two recommended ways to transition a data factory across environments:\n\nLeveraging Azure Pipelines for an automated deployment.\nManually uploading an ARM template through the Data Factory user interface integrated with Azure Resource Manager."

    "text": "Embracing Source Control in ADF\nAzure Data Factory’s integration with ARM templates facilitates the deployment of pipelines. Notably, there’s a distinct ADF Publish branch and a collaboration branch.\nSteps for Integrating Source Control with Branching Strategy:\n\nInitialize the Git Repository: Start by initializing a single Git repository. This repository will house multiple ADF configurations, each tailored for specific pipelines.\nBranching Blueprint: Designate a unique branch for every ADF, which will act as a collaboration branch. This setup will lead to the creation of distinct folders under the adf_publish branch. It’s crucial to have separate branches for development to allow individual feature development, testing, and deployment.Important to note that we may not use this branch as we will use automated ARM tempalte publishing methood.\nIntegrate Development Branches with Source Control: Only link the development branches with source control. This ensures continuous validation and checking of the code during its development phase. Keeping UAT/Production deployments separate ensures a clear demarcation between development and deployment phases.\nPipeline Deployment: Utilize the ARM templates produced by ADF to deploy your pipelines, ensuring a uniform deployment process.\nFinal Integration: Post thorough testing, merge the feature branches with the collaboration branch. The final version in the collaboration branch should be the one deployed to production."

    "text": "Advantages of Git Integration with Azure Data Factory\n1. Enhanced Source Control: As ADF tasks become increasingly critical, it’s essential to:\n\nSeamlessly track and audit changes.\nEffortlessly revert unwanted modifications.\n\n2. Flexible Drafting: Unlike direct authoring, which mandates validation for every save, Git integration allows:\n\nDrafting or partial saves.\nIncremental modifications without validation, ensuring only thoroughly tested changes are published.\n\n3. Collaborative Environment & Role-Based Access: Git facilitates:\n\nCollaborative code reviews.\nDifferentiated permissions, dictating who can edit via Git and who has publishing rights.\n\n4. Streamlined CI/CD Process: Git aids in:\n\nAutomating release pipelines upon changes.\nCustomizing ARM template properties for cleaner configuration management.\n\n5. Boosted Performance: ADFs integrated with Git are significantly faster, loading up to a whopping 10 times quicker due to efficient resource downloading.\nIt’s worth noting that direct authoring in the Azure Data Factory UI becomes disabled once a Git repository is integrated. However, modifications made via PowerShell or SDK are directly published to the Data Factory service, bypassing Git."

    "text": "Implementing the Pipeline Template\nThis guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough on setting up and utilizing the Azure Data Factory CI/CD pipeline as defined in the YAML file. The pipeline streamlines the build and deployment of ADF artifacts to designated environments.\nPrerequisites:\n\nAzure Data Factory Instance: An active ADF instance in Azure.\nAzure DevOps: The YAML is tailored for Azure DevOps. Ensure you have an active Azure DevOps organization and project.\nAzure DevOps Agent: The pipeline employs the ubuntu-latest VM image.\nNode.js: The initial stage requires Node.js.\nAzure Subscription: Necessary permissions on your Azure subscription are required.\n\nTo download necessery package for the npm, keep package.json file in the parent directory\n{\n    \"scripts\":{\n        \"build\":\"node node_modules/@microsoft/azure-data-factory-utilities/lib/index\"\n    },\n    \"dependencies\":{\n        \"@microsoft/azure-data-factory-utilities\":\"^1.0.0\"\n    }\n}\nRepository Structure:\nThe ADF code should be housed in a folder named data-factory-directory at the root of your repository.\nSetup & Execution:\n\nAzure Service Connection: Establish a service connection in Azure DevOps linked to your Azure subscription.\nGlobalParametersUpdateScript.ps1: If the modifyGlobalParams flag is set to true, ensure a PowerShell script named GlobalParamsScript.ps1 is present at the root of your repository.\nUsing the Pipeline: Upload the YAML file to your Azure DevOps repository, create a new pipeline, fill in the parameters, trigger the pipeline, and monitor the build and deployment.\n\nRunning the Pipeline\nPush some changes to developmentbranch. and the pipeline will get triggered automatically\n\nOnce the pipeline finished see the artifact that got published.\n\nSimilarly once the pipeline gets approval for deployment, it will deploy the updated template to production,\n\nModifications & Best Practices:\n\nGlobal Parameter Update: Adjust the logic in the optional global parameter update task if needed.\nAdditional Tasks: Insert any extra tasks within the steps section of the stages.\nPermissions: Not every team member should have update permissions. Implement a system where only a select few can publish to the Data Factory.\nUsing Azure Key Vault: For security, store connection strings or passwords in Azure Key Vault or use managed identity authentication for ADF Linked Services.\n\nIn conclusion, integrating CI/CD with Azure Data Factory not only streamlines the deployment process but also enhances collaboration, auditing, and overall efficiency. With the right setup and best practices, teams can ensure seamless and error-free deployments."

I’ve covered the fundamental best practices that every Azure administrator needs to be aware of in this document. I’ve also provided advice on how to create a secure, reliable, and effective Azure infrastructure. These best practices must be followed in tandem because none of them by themselves can adequately secure the systems.

To provide safe remote access to Azure virtual machines, use one of these techniques:\n✓ Enable site-to-site VPN or ExpressRoute connections for Just-In-Time (JIT) VM access:\nJIT offers time-limited VM access through RDP and SSH, which lessens the exposure to brute force assaults. In essence, Network Security Groups (NSGs) lock off RDP and SSH ports and only permit authorized users to access them for a predetermined time. Users can request access to JIT VMs using Azure AD and role-based Access Control (RBAC) permissions.\n✓ Configure Azure Bastion inside your virtual network.\nDirect RDP/SSH communication to your VMs over TLS from the Azure interface is made possible by Azure Bastion.

These resources are pricey! Common examples of these Azure orphan resources include network cards and OS discs. Fortunately, the Azure Portal assists in reminding administrators to delete unnecessary resources at provisioning and deletion time."

    "text": "Services:\nIn this section let us see in detail the most used resources and the best way to use those,\n➢ Virtual Machine\n✓ Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and complex passwords. MFA can help limit the threat of compromised credentials. Complex passwords help reduce the effectiveness of brute-force password attacks. ✓ Use just-in-time (JIT) virtual machine access. JIT access works with NSGs and the Azure firewall and helps you layer in role-based access controls (RBAC) and time-bindings on access to virtual machines.\n✓ Have a patch process in place. If you’re not patching your workloads, all your other efforts may be for nothing. A single unpatched vulnerability can lead to a breach. A patch process to keep your operating systems and applications up to date helps you mitigate this risk.\n✓ Lock down administrative ports. Unless necessary, restrict access to SSH, RDP, WinRM, and other administrative ports.\n✓ Use the Azure firewall and network security groups (NGSs) to limit access to workloads. Consistent with the principle of least privilege, use NSGs and the Azure firewall to restrict workload access.\n✓ Apply the Latest OS Patches Ensure that the latest OS patches available for Microsoft Azure virtual machines are applied.\n✓ Approved Azure Machine Image in Use Ensure that all your Azure virtual machine instances are launched from approved machine images only.\n✓ Enable Auto-Shutdown Configure your Microsoft Azure virtual machines to automatically shut down on a daily basis.\n➢ Storage\n✓ Restrict database and storage access. UseFirewalls and access controls to limit what level of access users, devices, and services have to your databases and storage blobs.\n✓ Leverage auditing. Turn on auditing for your Azure databases. Doing so enables you to gain visibility into all database changes.\n✓ Configure threat detection for Azure SQL. If you use Azure SQL, activating threat detection helps you identify security issues faster and limit dwell time.\n✓ Set log alerts in Azure Monitor. It isn’t enough to simply log events. Make sure you are alerting against security-related events in Azure Monitor so you can remediate issues quickly (and automatically when possible).\n✓ Enable Azure Defender for your storage accounts. Azure Defender provides you with hardening and securing your Azure storage accounts.\n✓ Use soft deletes. Soft deletes help you ensure data is still retrievable (for 14 days) in the event a malicious actor (or user error) leads to data you wanted to keep — getting deleted.\n✓ Use shared access signatures (SAS). SAS enables you to implement granular access controls and time limits on client access to data.\n✓ Disable Anonymous Access to Blob Containers Ensure that anonymous access to blob containers is disabled within your Azure Storage account.\n✓ Disable public access to storage accounts with blob containers Ensure that public access to blob containers is disabled for your Azure storage accounts to override any ACL configurations allowing access.\n➢ Network\n✓ Encrypt data in transit. As we mentioned in the encryption and data security section: encryption of data in transit (and at rest) is a must. Leverage modern encryption protocols for all network traffic.\n✓ Implement zero trust. By default, network policies should deny access unless there is an explicit allow rule.\n✓ Limit open ports and Internet-facing endpoints. Unless there is a well-defined business reason for a port to be open or workload to be Internet-facing, don’t let it happen.\n✓ Monitor device access. Monitoring access to your workloads and devices (e.g. using a SIEM or Azure Monitor) helps you proactively detect threats\n✓ Segment your networks. Logical network segmentation can help improve visibility, make your networks easier to manage and limit east-west movement in the event of a breach.\n✓ Check for NSG Flow Log Retention Period Ensure that the Network Security Group (NSG) flow log retention period is greater than or equal to 90 days.\n✓ Check for Network Security Groups with Port Ranges Ensure there are no network security groups with a range of ports opened to allow incoming traffic.\n✓ Enable DDoS Standard Protection for Virtual Networks Ensure that DDoS standard protection is enabled for production Azure virtual networks.\n✓ Monitor Network Security Group Configuration Changes Network security group changes have been detected in your Microsoft Azure cloud account.\n✓ Review Network Interfaces with IP Forwarding Enabled Ensure that the Azure network interfaces with IP forwarding enabled are regularly reviewed."

    "title": "Creating Azure Web App CI/CD with Terraform and Azure DevOps",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Kunal Das, Author\nIntroduction:\nIn today’s fast-paced development environment, implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is crucial for efficient software delivery. In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of setting up a CI/CD pipeline for an Azure web app using Terraform and Azure DevOps. By following these steps, you can automate the deployment process and ensure high-quality code reaches your production environment.\nPrerequisites:\nBefore we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:\n- An Azure DevOps account\n- Access to an Azure subscription\n- Basic knowledge of Terraform and Docker\nStep 1: Creating Infrastructure with Terraform\nTo ensure a consistent and repeatable infrastructure setup, we will use Terraform. Terraform allows us to define our infrastructure as code and manage it through version control. Follow these steps to create the necessary infrastructure for your Azure web app:\n1. Set up a new Azure DevOps project.\n2. Create a new repository within your project and clone it to your local machine.\n3. Create a folder structure for your Terraform code, such as “infra/environment1” and “infra/environment2” for two environments.\n4. Within each environment folder, create a main.tf file and define the necessary Azure resources, such as resource groups, app services, and databases. Use Terraform modules to ensure a modular and reusable infrastructure setup.\n5. Define input variables in a separate variable.tf file to make your infrastructure code dynamic and easily configurable.\n6. Initialize Terraform within each environment folder by running the `terraform init` command. This will download the required providers and modules.\n7. Create a build pipeline in Azure DevOps to trigger the Terraform deployment. Use the “Terraform CLI” task to execute Terraform commands, passing the appropriate input variables for each environment.\nStep 2: CI Steps\nIn this step, we will set up Continuous Integration (CI) to ensure code quality and generate artifacts for deployment.\n1. Configure your source code repository in Azure DevOps to trigger the CI pipeline on code changes.\n2. Set up a build pipeline in Azure DevOps with the following steps:\na. Use a task to install the required dependencies for your application, such as Python packages.\nb. Run unit tests using your preferred testing framework (e.g., pytest) to ensure code functionality.\nc. Use linters (flake8, black) and formatters (isort) to enforce code style consistency.\nd. Generate a code coverage report using coverage.py to track the percentage of code covered by tests.\ne. Integrate with SonarQube for static code analysis and maintain code quality.\nf. Build a Docker image containing your application code and dependencies.\ng. Push the Docker image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR) for later use in deployment.\nStep 3: CD — Continuous Deployment\nNow that we have our infrastructure in place and a reliable CI process, we can proceed to set up Continuous Deployment (CD) to automate the deployment process.\n1. Determine the deployment strategy based on your requirements. For example:\n— Two environments (dev and prod) can follow a simple deployment flow where the code is deployed to dev first and then promoted to prod after successful testing.\n— Three environments (dev, test, and prod) can follow a more complex deployment flow where code moves through each environment sequentially.\n2. Create release pipelines in Azure DevOps for each environment, using the appropriate deployment strategy.\n3. Configure post-deployment tests specific to each environment to ensure the deployed application is functioning as expected.\n4. Add performance testing steps after the deployment to the dev environment to validate system\nperformance under real-world conditions. Use tools like Apache JMeter or Azure Application Insights to conduct performance tests.\nCertainly! Below are the code snippets for each step, following a generic parameterized approach and best practices:\nStep 1: Creating Infrastructure with Terraform\n1. Set up Azure DevOps pipeline:\n— Create a new pipeline in Azure DevOps and select your repository.\n— Choose the appropriate trigger for your pipeline, such as a repository branch or pull request.\n2. Configure Terraform backend:\n— Create an Azure Storage Account to store Terraform state.\n— Add the following code to your `main.tf` file within each environment folder:\n3. Define variables:\n— Create a `variables.tf` file within each environment folder to define input variables. Here’s an example:\n4. Create infrastructure resources:\nAdd the following code to create a resource group and app service plan in the `main.tf` file within each environment folder:\n5. Execute Terraform commands in Azure DevOps pipeline:\nAdd the following steps to your Azure DevOps pipeline YAML file:\nStep 2: CI Steps\n1. Configure CI pipeline triggers and variables:\n— Define your pipeline triggers and variables in the Azure DevOps YAML file, as per your requirements.\n2. Set up build steps:\n— Use appropriate task names and commands based on your specific needs. Here’s an example:\n3. Build and push Docker image:\n— Use the appropriate task names and commands based on your specific needs. Here’s an example:\nStep 3: CD — Continuous Deployment\n1. Determine deployment strategy and set up release pipelines:\n— Based on your deployment strategy, define the release pipelines in Azure DevOps with appropriate stages and triggers.\n2. Configure post-deployment tests:\n— Use the appropriate tasks and scripts to run post-deployment tests. Here’s an example:\n3. Perform performance testing:\n— Use the appropriate tasks and scripts to perform performance testing. Here’s an example using Apache JMeter:\nNote: The provided code snippets serve as examples and may require modifications based on your specific application, environment, and tools being used.\nRemember to update the connection names, resource names, and specific command arguments according to your project setup and requirements."

    "section": "2.3 Limitations",
    "text": "2.3 Limitations\nInfracost is a useful tool for gaining visibility into the cost of your infrastructure and optimizing your spend on cloud resources. However, it does have some limitations to consider:\nLimited to supported cloud providers: Infracost currently supports only a limited number of cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. If you are using a different cloud provider or a combination of multiple providers, Infracost may not be able to provide cost estimates for your infrastructure.\nDependent on accurate resource pricing: Infracost relies on accurate resource pricing information from the supported cloud providers. If the pricing information is incorrect or out of date, Infracost cost estimates may not be accurate.\nLimited to resources supported by the cloud providers: Infracost can only provide cost estimates for resources that are supported by the cloud providers it integrates with. If you are using custom resources or resources from third-party providers, Infracost may not be able to provide cost estimates for them.\nRequires manual integration with infrastructure as code: While Infracost integrates with popular infrastructure as code tools such as Terraform and CloudFormation, it requires manual integration. This means you will need to set up Infracost and configure it to work with your infrastructure as code tools, which can be time-consuming and require some technical expertise.\nLimited to infrastructure costs: Infracost only provides estimates for the cost of your infrastructure resources, such as compute instances and storage. It does not include other costs such as data transfer fees or licensing costs for third-party software.\nLimited to current infrastructure: Infracost only provides cost estimates for your current infrastructure. It does not allow you to compare the cost of different infrastructure configurations or predict the cost of future infrastructure changes.\nOverall, while Infracost is a useful tool for gaining visibility into the cost of your infrastructure and optimizing your spend on cloud resources, it is limited in its scope and may not be suitable for all organizations or infrastructure configurations."

    "section": "2.4 Use cases",
    "text": "2.4 Use cases\nSome possible use cases for Infracost include:\nIdentifying and reducing over-provisioned resources: Infracost can help you identify resources that are over-provisioned, which means they have more capacity than is necessary to meet your workload demands. By reducing the capacity of these resources, you can save on your cloud costs.\nOptimizing resource usage: Infracost can help you optimize resource usage by identifying underutilized resources and suggesting ways to improve their utilization. For example, if you have a virtual machine that is only running at 20% capacity, Infracost may suggest moving workloads to that machine to better utilize its capacity.\nEstimating costs for infrastructure changes: Infracost can be used to estimate the costs of making changes to your infrastructure, such as adding or removing resources. This can help you plan for changes and ensure that they are cost-effective.\nAnalysing cloud cost trends: Infracost can provide detailed cost breakdowns and graphs that allow you to understand your cloud costs over time and identify trends that may impact your budget. This can help you plan and make decisions to optimize your costs.\nAuditing and compliance: Infracost can be used to audit your infrastructure and ensure that it complies with company policies or regulatory requirements. It can also help you identify resources that may be overpriced or misconfigured, allowing you to take corrective action."

I’m Kunal Das, and I’ve been working with containers and cloud platforms for years , I’ve seen countless teams struggle with Kubernetes complexity while just wanting to deploy their applications reliably and cost-effectively.\nThat’s exactly why I’m so passionate about Azure Container Apps. It’s Microsoft’s answer to a problem I see every day - teams who need the power of containers without the operational nightmare of managing Kubernetes clusters. With serverless GPU support now generally available and adoption surging 48% year-over-year, I’ve watched Azure Container Apps transform from an interesting option to a game-changing platform.\nThroughout this guide, I’ll share real experiences from my work, practical insights from production deployments, and a hands-on demo using an application I built specifically to showcase ACA’s capabilities. Whether you’re a developer tired of YAML complexity or an architect evaluating container platforms, I want to help you understand why companies like Fujitsu are reporting “unparalleled cost savings” and how you can achieve similar results.\nIf you prefer learning by watching, I’ve also created a comprehensive video walkthrough that demonstrates these concepts in action.\n\n\n\nAfter working with AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Run, and traditional Kubernetes, I can tell you that Azure Container Apps occupies a unique position that I haven’t seen elsewhere. It’s the only platform I’ve used that truly focuses on microservices from the ground up, rather than treating them as an afterthought.\nLet me explain what I mean by walking through a real scenario. When I deploy applications on AWS Fargate, I typically end up configuring over twenty different AWS resources just to get a basic setup running. The complexity grows exponentially when you need service discovery, load balancing, and auto-scaling. Google Cloud Run, while incredibly fast to deploy, limits you to single-container applications, which becomes restrictive when building actual microservices architectures.\nAzure Container Apps takes a fundamentally different approach. The platform provides built-in DAPR integration, which means service discovery, state management, and pub/sub messaging work out of the box. No additional configuration, no separate service mesh deployment, no complex networking setup. When I first experienced this, it felt like magic - but it’s actually just thoughtful platform design.\nThe KEDA integration deserves special mention because it’s something I use extensively in production. While other platforms offer basic CPU and memory scaling, ACA provides event-driven autoscaling based on external metrics. I can scale applications based on queue depth, database connections, or even custom business metrics. This capability alone has saved my teams countless hours of custom scaling logic development.\nThe scale-to-zero default configuration represents something I consider a paradigm shift in container economics. Traditional platforms charge you for idle resources - those containers sitting around waiting for traffic. With ACA, when there’s no traffic, there’s no cost. I’ve seen this feature reduce hosting costs by 60-80% for applications with variable traffic patterns, and that’s not marketing hype - those are real numbers from production workloads I manage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nThis year has been particularly exciting for Azure Container Apps, and I’ve had the opportunity to test several groundbreaking features that fundamentally change what’s possible with serverless containers.\nThe serverless GPUs feature became generally available early this year, and I can honestly say it’s transformed how I think about AI workload deployment. Having access to NVIDIA A100 and T4 GPUs with scale-to-zero capabilities means I can deploy machine learning models without the traditional infrastructure concerns. The per-second billing model makes experimentation affordable, while the scale-to-zero capability ensures I’m not burning money when models aren’t being used.\nI’ve been testing this in West US 3, and the cold start performance has been impressive. The team at Microsoft has clearly invested significant effort in optimizing the startup sequence for GPU workloads. What used to require dedicated GPU clusters and complex scheduling can now be deployed with a simple container image and scaling configuration.\nThe dedicated GPUs option, launched at Build 2025, fills a crucial gap for production AI applications that need consistent availability. While serverless GPUs excel for inference workloads with variable demand, dedicated GPUs provide the reliability needed for training workloads or applications requiring guaranteed response times.\nThe premium ingress capabilities currently in public preview address something I’ve wanted for years - environment-level traffic management without deploying separate reverse proxy infrastructure. The rule-based routing enables sophisticated deployment patterns including A/B testing and blue-green deployments that previously required additional tooling and complexity.\nPrivate endpoints achieving general availability represents a major step forward for enterprise adoption. Many of the organizations I work with have strict network security requirements, and the ability to deploy Container Apps within Azure Virtual Networks with private connectivity addresses these concerns while maintaining the simplicity that makes ACA attractive.\n\n\n\nLet me share some real-world examples that demonstrate the practical impact of Azure Container Apps, starting with one that particularly impressed me.\nFujitsu Japan Limited implemented Azure Container Apps for their Master Data Management system using Java microservices. What caught my attention wasn’t just their reported “unparalleled cost savings” - it was how they achieved these results. Their implementation scales from zero to hundreds of instances automatically while eliminating the operational burden that typically comes with Kubernetes management. The development team can focus entirely on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns.\nI’ve personally worked on a cost analysis that revealed some striking numbers. A small-load production web application handling 1,000 to 5,000 requests per hour during business hours and 10,000 to 20,000 requests during peak periods cost approximately 19 euros per month on Azure Container Apps compared to 101 euros per month on Azure App Service. That’s an 80% cost reduction while actually improving scalability and performance characteristics.\nThe team at endjin consulting documented their migration from Azure Functions to Azure Container Apps, which resonated with challenges I’ve seen in my own work. They successfully migrated ASP.NET Core .NET 6.0 APIs while eliminating cold start issues and achieving significantly lower costs than Azure Functions Premium plan. This migration maintained their existing Azure infrastructure while delivering better cost-performance ratios for HTTP API workloads.\nFrom my experience managing production workloads, the performance benchmarks consistently show container scaling ranges from zero to one thousand replicas with KEDA-powered autoscaling. The scaling triggers work reliably across HTTP requests, TCP connections, CPU and memory thresholds, and custom metrics. Teams I work with report approximately 30% reduction in development time through simplified deployment processes and integrated monitoring capabilities.\n\n\n\nHaving worked extensively with all major serverless container platforms, I want to give you an honest comparison based on real-world experience rather than marketing materials.\nThe serverless container market has experienced explosive growth, with adoption increasing from 31% to 46% of container organizations in just two years according to Datadog’s research. This 48% growth rate indicates rapid technology maturation, and the serverless architecture market projecting 21.1 billion dollars by 2025 shows this isn’t a temporary trend.\nAzure Container Apps provides the only platform I’ve used with native DAPR integration. This isn’t just a nice-to-have feature - it fundamentally changes how you build and deploy microservices. Service discovery, state management, and pub/sub messaging work without additional configuration or complexity. The built-in KEDA integration offers superior event-driven scaling based on external metrics, capabilities that competitors require significant additional configuration to achieve.\nAWS Fargate maintains the lowest compute costs across regions, but the setup complexity is substantial. You typically need to configure over twenty AWS resources and the deployment process lacks true serverless characteristics since you still need underlying ECS or EKS clusters. Deployment times can extend up to twenty minutes compared to competitors, which impacts development velocity.\nGoogle Cloud Run offers the best developer experience I’ve encountered, with deployment times measured in seconds rather than minutes. However, the platform limits you to single-container deployments and doesn’t support full Kubernetes pod definitions. This becomes restrictive when building actual microservices architectures or applications requiring sidecar containers.\nTraditional Kubernetes remains appropriate for applications requiring direct API access, complex multi-service orchestration, or multi-cloud portability requirements. However, the operational overhead is significant, and unless you have specific requirements that mandate Kubernetes, the complexity rarely justifies the benefits for most applications.\n\n\n\nOne of the aspects I appreciate most about Azure Container Apps is the transparent and developer-friendly pricing model. Let me walk you through the details based on my experience managing costs across multiple production environments.\nThe consumption plan offers genuinely generous free monthly allowances that cover substantial development and testing workloads. You get 180,000 vCPU-seconds, 360,000 GiB-seconds, and 2 million HTTP requests per subscription each month at no cost. To put this in perspective, the vCPU allowance supports approximately fifty hours of continuous single-vCPU operation, while the request allowance accommodates significant development and testing activity.\nBeyond the free tiers, the platform uses per-second billing for both active and idle usage, with reduced rates during inactive periods. This granular billing model means you pay only for actual resource consumption rather than provisioned capacity, a fundamental shift from traditional hosting models.\nThe serverless GPU pricing represents something I consider revolutionary in AI workload economics. Both NC T4 v3 and NC A100 v4 options support scale-to-zero capability, which eliminates costs during idle periods. Previously, deploying expensive GPU resources meant constant billing regardless of utilization. Now you can deploy sophisticated AI workloads without worrying about idle resource costs.\nAzure Savings Plans provide up to 17% savings with one to three year commitments applicable to both Consumption and Dedicated plans. The dedicated plan model becomes cost-effective for higher scale deployments with steady throughput, offering workload profile sharing across multiple applications.\nFrom my cost optimization work, I recommend implementing scale-to-zero configurations wherever possible, right-sizing resource allocations through regular Azure Monitor analysis, and leveraging workload profiles efficiently. Organizations should maximize free tier usage during development and consider GPU workload patterns when choosing between serverless and dedicated GPU options.\n\n\n\nHaving implemented Azure Container Apps in enterprise environments, I can speak to the integration capabilities that matter in production deployments. The platform provides comprehensive integration with the Azure ecosystem through native support that works reliably without complex configuration.\nIdentity and access management includes built-in Azure Active Directory integration with Easy Auth for zero-code authentication supporting multiple identity providers. The managed identity support offers both system-assigned and user-assigned options for password-less access to Azure services. This eliminates the security risk and operational overhead of managing connection strings and API keys.\nDatabase integration spans the services I use most frequently in production deployments. Azure Cosmos DB supports NoSQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL APIs with seamless connectivity. Azure SQL Database works with managed identity authentication, eliminating connection string management. Azure Storage services integrate naturally for both structured and unstructured data requirements.\nKey Vault integration provides secure secret management with automatic retrieval using managed identities. This addresses one of the most common security anti-patterns I see - storing secrets in environment variables or configuration files. The integration works transparently, retrieving secrets at runtime without requiring application code changes.\nNetworking security features include Virtual Network integration, private endpoints through Azure Private Link, and peer-to-peer TLS encryption within environments. The compliance certifications include SOC 1/2/3, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and PCI DSS standards with built-in Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark compliance, addressing enterprise governance requirements I encounter regularly.\nCI/CD integration offers native support for Azure DevOps pipelines and GitHub Actions with automatic workflow generation. The platform includes comprehensive monitoring through Azure Monitor integration with CPU, memory, and network metrics, plus Application Insights for distributed tracing across microservices architectures.\n\n\n\nAfter helping several teams migrate from Kubernetes to Azure Container Apps, I’ve developed approaches that minimize disruption while maximizing the benefits of the platform transition.\nOrganizations I’ve worked with report significant operational simplification while maintaining container benefits. Microsoft’s official migration approach includes the Azure Migrate App Containerization Tool supporting ASP.NET and Java web applications with automated discovery and deployment capabilities.\nThe key migration considerations I always discuss include networking requirements, since consumption plans require a minimum /23 network size, configuration mapping from Kubernetes Services to Container Apps, and persistent storage migration to Azure Files or Blob Storage. These aren’t blockers, but they require planning and coordination.\nCommon challenges I help teams navigate include applications with Kubernetes API dependencies requiring refactoring, Helm chart incompatibility necessitating conversion to ACA deployment specifications, and custom monitoring solutions needing migration to Azure Monitor. These challenges are manageable with proper planning and staged approaches.\nThe developer experience improvements consistently impress teams making the transition. Reduced learning curves mean team members don’t need extensive Kubernetes knowledge, faster onboarding helps new team members contribute quickly, and the approximately 30% reduction in development time comes from eliminating infrastructure complexity.\nMigration success factors I’ve identified through experience include thorough dependency assessment before beginning the transition, gradual phased approaches that allow learning and adjustment, team training investment to build confidence with new tools, and proper observability establishment from deployment initiation to maintain visibility during the transition.\n\n\n\nNow let’s get practical. I want to walk you through deploying a real application that demonstrates Azure Container Apps capabilities in action. We’ll use the Beautiful Quotes App, which I built specifically to showcase modern web application patterns including dynamic content, API integration, and responsive design.\nThe complete source code and deployment instructions are available in my Azure Container Apps Demo repository, and I encourage you to follow along. If you prefer visual learning, check out my detailed video walkthrough where I demonstrate these concepts step by step.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\nThe Beautiful Quotes App represents a typical modern web application built with containerization principles. I chose this example because it demonstrates several important architectural patterns that translate well to enterprise scenarios.\nThe frontend consists of a single-page application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I made this choice deliberately to emphasize that Azure Container Apps works with any containerized application, regardless of technology stack. The application features dynamic background animations using HTML5 Canvas, theme customization, and social sharing capabilities representing common modern web application requirements.\nThe backend integration connects to the QuoteHub API for dynamic content, demonstrating how containerized applications typically consume external services. This pattern mirrors enterprise applications that integrate with multiple APIs, databases, and microservices in production environments.\nThe containerization strategy uses nginx Alpine as the base image, which I selected for its production-ready characteristics that minimize attack surface while providing excellent performance. The simple Dockerfile demonstrates best practices for static content serving that can be extended for more complex applications.\n\n\n\nLet’s start with the prerequisites. You’ll need Azure CLI with the Container Apps extension, which provides specialized commands for Container Apps management that aren’t available in the core Azure CLI. The extension handles the complexity of underlying Kubernetes operations while exposing simplified, developer-friendly commands.\n# Install the Container Apps extension with debug output for troubleshooting\naz extension add --name containerapp --debug\nI always recommend using the debug flag because it provides valuable troubleshooting information if installation encounters issues, particularly in corporate environments with proxy configurations.\nNext, we’ll establish your deployment context through authentication and subscription management. The device code flow works reliably across different environments, including cloud shells and restricted networks.\n# Authenticate using device code flow\naz login --use-device-code\n\n# Set your specific subscription context\naz account set --subscription \"&lt;your-subscription-id&gt;\"\nUnderstanding subscription context is crucial because Azure Container Apps resources are subscription-scoped, and pricing varies by region and subscription type.\n\n\n\nResource group creation establishes the logical container for all related resources. I’m using the Central India region for this demo, which demonstrates global availability while potentially offering cost advantages for certain workloads.\n# Create resource group in Central India region\naz group create --name quotes-app-rg --location centralindia\nResource groups provide lifecycle management, access control boundaries, and cost tracking capabilities. All our demo resources will be contained within this group for easy cleanup when we’re finished.\nProvider registration ensures the Azure subscription has access to required services. The OperationalInsights provider enables logging and monitoring capabilities that integrate with Container Apps environments.\n# Register the required provider for logging\naz provider register -n Microsoft.OperationalInsights --wait\nThe wait flag ensures the registration completes before proceeding, which is essential for subsequent commands that depend on these services.\nContainer Apps environment creation establishes the deployment boundary for your applications. Environments provide shared infrastructure including networking, logging, and scaling capabilities.\n# Create the Container Apps environment\naz containerapp env create --name quotes-app-env --resource-group quotes-app-rg --location centralindia\nEnvironments abstract away underlying Kubernetes complexity while providing enterprise features like Virtual Network integration, private endpoints, and workload profiles. Multiple applications can share a single environment, optimizing costs through resource sharing.\n\n\n\nThe basic deployment demonstrates core Container Apps functionality with minimal configuration complexity.\n# Deploy with basic configuration\naz containerapp create \\\n  --name beautiful-quotes-app \\\n  --resource-group quotes-app-rg \\\n  --environment quotes-app-env \\\n  --image kunalondock/beautiful-quotes-app:v1 \\\n  --target-port 80 \\\n  --ingress external \\\n  --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn\nThis command creates a Container App with external ingress, meaning it’s accessible from the internet. The target-port 80 specification matches the nginx configuration in the Dockerfile. The query parameter extracts the fully qualified domain name for immediate access to your deployed application.\nThe deployment uses the pre-built container image from Docker Hub, eliminating the need for local Docker builds during initial testing. This pattern accelerates development workflows and simplifies CI/CD pipeline integration.\n\n\n\nNow let’s explore Azure Container Apps’ sophisticated scaling capabilities that distinguish it from traditional hosting solutions.\n# Deploy with auto-scaling configuration\naz containerapp create \\\n  --name beautiful-quotes-app \\\n  --resource-group quotes-app-rg \\\n  --environment quotes-app-env \\\n  --image kunalondock/beautiful-quotes-app:v1 \\\n  --min-replicas 0 \\\n  --max-replicas 5 \\\n  --scale-rule-name azure-http-rule \\\n  --scale-rule-type http \\\n  --scale-rule-http-concurrency 3 \\\n  --target-port 80 \\\n  --ingress external \\\n  --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn\nThe scale-to-zero configuration represents a fundamental shift from traditional hosting models. When no requests are active, the application consumes zero compute resources and incurs no charges. This capability alone can reduce hosting costs by 60% to 80% for applications with variable traffic patterns.\nThe HTTP-based scaling rule with concurrency setting of 3 means new instances launch when existing instances handle more than three concurrent requests. This setting balances responsiveness with resource efficiency. Lower concurrency values provide better performance but higher costs, while higher values optimize costs but may impact response times.\nThe maximum replica limit of 5 provides cost protection while allowing substantial traffic handling. Each replica can handle the configured concurrency, so this configuration supports 15 concurrent requests maximum before queuing occurs.\n\n\n\nLog analysis provides insights into application behavior and performance characteristics that help you understand how your application performs in production.\n# View application logs for troubleshooting\naz containerapp logs show --name beautiful-quotes-app --resource-group quotes-app-rg\nContainer Apps automatically aggregates logs from all replicas, providing unified visibility into application behavior. Logs include both application output and platform events like scaling decisions, making troubleshooting significantly easier than traditional container platforms.\nMonitoring integration occurs automatically through Azure Monitor, providing metrics for CPU utilization, memory consumption, request counts, and response times. This observability comes without additional configuration, which represents a significant advantage over self-managed container platforms.\n\n\n\nLocal development begins with the provided source code from my Azure Container Apps Demo repository, allowing complete customization of functionality, styling, and behavior.\n# Build your custom version locally\ndocker build -t your-username/quotes-app:v1 .\n\n# Test locally before deployment\ndocker run -d -p 8080:80 your-username/quotes-app:v1\nThe Dockerfile optimization uses nginx Alpine for minimal footprint and maximum security. The multi-stage build pattern can be extended for applications requiring compilation steps, asset processing, or dependency installation.\nContainer registry publishing enables deployment from your customized image.\n# Publish to Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry\ndocker login\ndocker push your-username/quotes-app:v1\nProduction considerations include implementing health checks, configuring startup probes for complex initialization sequences, and establishing proper logging patterns for observability in production environments.\n\n\n\nThis demo deployment demonstrates cost optimization principles that apply to production workloads. The scale-to-zero configuration means the application costs nothing during inactive periods. During active periods, costs remain minimal due to efficient resource utilization.\nFree tier usage covers substantial testing and development workloads. The 180,000 vCPU-seconds monthly allowance supports approximately fifty hours of continuous single-vCPU operation, while the 2 million request allowance accommodates significant development activity without incurring charges.\nProduction scaling from this demo foundation requires analyzing traffic patterns, adjusting concurrency settings, and potentially implementing more sophisticated scaling rules based on queue depth, database connections, or custom metrics that reflect your specific application requirements.\n\n\n\n\nLet me share the lessons I’ve learned from deploying and managing Azure Container Apps in production environments. These practices come from real-world experience rather than theoretical knowledge.\nApplication architecture should follow stateless design principles optimized for horizontal scaling. I always recommend designing applications so that any instance can handle any request without depending on local state. Container image optimization includes using smaller base images, implementing multi-stage builds, and storing large files in Azure Storage rather than container images to reduce cold start latency.\nScaling configuration requires careful analysis of traffic patterns to set appropriate minimum replicas, concurrent request thresholds, and cool-down periods. I typically start with conservative settings and adjust based on actual usage patterns rather than trying to optimize prematurely. Health probe configuration ensures proper application startup detection, which becomes particularly important for complex initialization processes.\nSecurity implementation involves configuring managed identities for service access, implementing Key Vault integration for secrets management, and establishing proper network security through Virtual Network integration where required. Never store secrets in environment variables or configuration files when managed identities and Key Vault provide secure alternatives.\nMonitoring and observability setup should include Azure Monitor metrics, Application Insights instrumentation, and Log Analytics workspace configuration. Cost monitoring through Azure Cost Management with budget alerts prevents unexpected charges and enables optimization opportunities before they become problematic.\nCI/CD pipeline design should leverage native GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps integration with automated testing, blue-green deployment strategies, and proper environment management across development, staging, and production environments.\n\n\n\nAs I look toward the future of container orchestration, Azure Container Apps represents what I consider a strategic inflection point in how we deploy and manage applications. The platform offers enterprise-grade capabilities without the operational complexity that has traditionally accompanied container orchestration.\nThe unique microservices focus through built-in DAPR and KEDA integration, combined with revolutionary AI capabilities through serverless GPUs, positions Azure Container Apps as a compelling choice for modern application architectures. Organizations should consider Azure Container Apps when building microservices requiring service discovery, developing event-driven applications with external scaling triggers, or operating within Microsoft ecosystem environments.\nThe platform particularly excels for variable workload applications benefiting from scale-to-zero cost optimization and teams seeking Kubernetes benefits without operational overhead. Cost analysis demonstrates substantial savings potential with documented cases showing 80% reductions compared to traditional hosting models. Combined with Azure Savings Plans offering up to 17% additional savings, the economic case becomes compelling for appropriate use cases.\nMigration from Kubernetes proves most successful with gradual approaches, proper team training, and realistic expectations about platform differences. While ACA doesn’t replace all Kubernetes use cases, it provides an attractive alternative for organizations prioritizing developer productivity and operational simplification.\nThe convergence of serverless computing, AI integration, and microservices architecture positions Azure Container Apps at the center of cloud-native application development trends. Organizations evaluating container platforms should carefully assess their specific requirements against ACA’s capabilities, considering both current needs and future strategic direction in the rapidly evolving serverless landscape.\n\n\n\n\nThis guide incorporates insights and data from several valuable sources that helped shape my understanding and analysis:\nMicrosoft Official Documentation - Azure Container Apps Overview provided comprehensive technical specifications and feature details\nDatadog Container Report 2024 - 10 insights on real-world container use offered crucial market adoption statistics and usage patterns\nGrand View Research - Serverless Architecture Market Analysis provided market size projections and growth trends\nApplied Information Sciences - Kubernetes Without the Complexity: Azure Container Apps contributed practical insights on complexity reduction\nMicrosoft Tech Community - Build 2025 Azure Container Apps Announcements provided latest feature updates and roadmap information\nFujitsu Case Study - Java on Azure Implementation offered real-world success story validation\nConnect with me for more insights: All my links and contact information\nWatch the hands-on demo: Azure Container Apps Tutorial on YouTube\nGet the source code: Azure Container Apps Demo Repository"

I’m Kunal Das, and I’ve been working with containers and cloud platforms for years , I’ve seen countless teams struggle with Kubernetes complexity while just wanting to deploy their applications reliably and cost-effectively.\nThat’s exactly why I’m so passionate about Azure Container Apps. It’s Microsoft’s answer to a problem I see every day - teams who need the power of containers without the operational nightmare of managing Kubernetes clusters. With serverless GPU support now generally available and adoption surging 48% year-over-year, I’ve watched Azure Container Apps transform from an interesting option to a game-changing platform.\nThroughout this guide, I’ll share real experiences from my work, practical insights from production deployments, and a hands-on demo using an application I built specifically to showcase ACA’s capabilities. Whether you’re a developer tired of YAML complexity or an architect evaluating container platforms, I want to help you understand why companies like Fujitsu are reporting “unparalleled cost savings” and how you can achieve similar results.\nIf you prefer learning by watching, I’ve also created a comprehensive video walkthrough that demonstrates these concepts in action."

    "text": "After working with AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Run, and traditional Kubernetes, I can tell you that Azure Container Apps occupies a unique position that I haven’t seen elsewhere. It’s the only platform I’ve used that truly focuses on microservices from the ground up, rather than treating them as an afterthought.\nLet me explain what I mean by walking through a real scenario. When I deploy applications on AWS Fargate, I typically end up configuring over twenty different AWS resources just to get a basic setup running. The complexity grows exponentially when you need service discovery, load balancing, and auto-scaling. Google Cloud Run, while incredibly fast to deploy, limits you to single-container applications, which becomes restrictive when building actual microservices architectures.\nAzure Container Apps takes a fundamentally different approach. The platform provides built-in DAPR integration, which means service discovery, state management, and pub/sub messaging work out of the box. No additional configuration, no separate service mesh deployment, no complex networking setup. When I first experienced this, it felt like magic - but it’s actually just thoughtful platform design.\nThe KEDA integration deserves special mention because it’s something I use extensively in production. While other platforms offer basic CPU and memory scaling, ACA provides event-driven autoscaling based on external metrics. I can scale applications based on queue depth, database connections, or even custom business metrics. This capability alone has saved my teams countless hours of custom scaling logic development.\nThe scale-to-zero default configuration represents something I consider a paradigm shift in container economics. Traditional platforms charge you for idle resources - those containers sitting around waiting for traffic. With ACA, when there’s no traffic, there’s no cost. I’ve seen this feature reduce hosting costs by 60-80% for applications with variable traffic patterns, and that’s not marketing hype - those are real numbers from production workloads I manage."

    "text": "image\n\n\nThis year has been particularly exciting for Azure Container Apps, and I’ve had the opportunity to test several groundbreaking features that fundamentally change what’s possible with serverless containers.\nThe serverless GPUs feature became generally available early this year, and I can honestly say it’s transformed how I think about AI workload deployment. Having access to NVIDIA A100 and T4 GPUs with scale-to-zero capabilities means I can deploy machine learning models without the traditional infrastructure concerns. The per-second billing model makes experimentation affordable, while the scale-to-zero capability ensures I’m not burning money when models aren’t being used.\nI’ve been testing this in West US 3, and the cold start performance has been impressive. The team at Microsoft has clearly invested significant effort in optimizing the startup sequence for GPU workloads. What used to require dedicated GPU clusters and complex scheduling can now be deployed with a simple container image and scaling configuration.\nThe dedicated GPUs option, launched at Build 2025, fills a crucial gap for production AI applications that need consistent availability. While serverless GPUs excel for inference workloads with variable demand, dedicated GPUs provide the reliability needed for training workloads or applications requiring guaranteed response times.\nThe premium ingress capabilities currently in public preview address something I’ve wanted for years - environment-level traffic management without deploying separate reverse proxy infrastructure. The rule-based routing enables sophisticated deployment patterns including A/B testing and blue-green deployments that previously required additional tooling and complexity.\nPrivate endpoints achieving general availability represents a major step forward for enterprise adoption. Many of the organizations I work with have strict network security requirements, and the ability to deploy Container Apps within Azure Virtual Networks with private connectivity addresses these concerns while maintaining the simplicity that makes ACA attractive."

    "text": "Let me share some real-world examples that demonstrate the practical impact of Azure Container Apps, starting with one that particularly impressed me.\nFujitsu Japan Limited implemented Azure Container Apps for their Master Data Management system using Java microservices. What caught my attention wasn’t just their reported “unparalleled cost savings” - it was how they achieved these results. Their implementation scales from zero to hundreds of instances automatically while eliminating the operational burden that typically comes with Kubernetes management. The development team can focus entirely on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns.\nI’ve personally worked on a cost analysis that revealed some striking numbers. A small-load production web application handling 1,000 to 5,000 requests per hour during business hours and 10,000 to 20,000 requests during peak periods cost approximately 19 euros per month on Azure Container Apps compared to 101 euros per month on Azure App Service. That’s an 80% cost reduction while actually improving scalability and performance characteristics.\nThe team at endjin consulting documented their migration from Azure Functions to Azure Container Apps, which resonated with challenges I’ve seen in my own work. They successfully migrated ASP.NET Core .NET 6.0 APIs while eliminating cold start issues and achieving significantly lower costs than Azure Functions Premium plan. This migration maintained their existing Azure infrastructure while delivering better cost-performance ratios for HTTP API workloads.\nFrom my experience managing production workloads, the performance benchmarks consistently show container scaling ranges from zero to one thousand replicas with KEDA-powered autoscaling. The scaling triggers work reliably across HTTP requests, TCP connections, CPU and memory thresholds, and custom metrics. Teams I work with report approximately 30% reduction in development time through simplified deployment processes and integrated monitoring capabilities."

    "text": "Having worked extensively with all major serverless container platforms, I want to give you an honest comparison based on real-world experience rather than marketing materials.\nThe serverless container market has experienced explosive growth, with adoption increasing from 31% to 46% of container organizations in just two years according to Datadog’s research. This 48% growth rate indicates rapid technology maturation, and the serverless architecture market projecting 21.1 billion dollars by 2025 shows this isn’t a temporary trend.\nAzure Container Apps provides the only platform I’ve used with native DAPR integration. This isn’t just a nice-to-have feature - it fundamentally changes how you build and deploy microservices. Service discovery, state management, and pub/sub messaging work without additional configuration or complexity. The built-in KEDA integration offers superior event-driven scaling based on external metrics, capabilities that competitors require significant additional configuration to achieve.\nAWS Fargate maintains the lowest compute costs across regions, but the setup complexity is substantial. You typically need to configure over twenty AWS resources and the deployment process lacks true serverless characteristics since you still need underlying ECS or EKS clusters. Deployment times can extend up to twenty minutes compared to competitors, which impacts development velocity.\nGoogle Cloud Run offers the best developer experience I’ve encountered, with deployment times measured in seconds rather than minutes. However, the platform limits you to single-container deployments and doesn’t support full Kubernetes pod definitions. This becomes restrictive when building actual microservices architectures or applications requiring sidecar containers.\nTraditional Kubernetes remains appropriate for applications requiring direct API access, complex multi-service orchestration, or multi-cloud portability requirements. However, the operational overhead is significant, and unless you have specific requirements that mandate Kubernetes, the complexity rarely justifies the benefits for most applications."

    "text": "One of the aspects I appreciate most about Azure Container Apps is the transparent and developer-friendly pricing model. Let me walk you through the details based on my experience managing costs across multiple production environments.\nThe consumption plan offers genuinely generous free monthly allowances that cover substantial development and testing workloads. You get 180,000 vCPU-seconds, 360,000 GiB-seconds, and 2 million HTTP requests per subscription each month at no cost. To put this in perspective, the vCPU allowance supports approximately fifty hours of continuous single-vCPU operation, while the request allowance accommodates significant development and testing activity.\nBeyond the free tiers, the platform uses per-second billing for both active and idle usage, with reduced rates during inactive periods. This granular billing model means you pay only for actual resource consumption rather than provisioned capacity, a fundamental shift from traditional hosting models.\nThe serverless GPU pricing represents something I consider revolutionary in AI workload economics. Both NC T4 v3 and NC A100 v4 options support scale-to-zero capability, which eliminates costs during idle periods. Previously, deploying expensive GPU resources meant constant billing regardless of utilization. Now you can deploy sophisticated AI workloads without worrying about idle resource costs.\nAzure Savings Plans provide up to 17% savings with one to three year commitments applicable to both Consumption and Dedicated plans. The dedicated plan model becomes cost-effective for higher scale deployments with steady throughput, offering workload profile sharing across multiple applications.\nFrom my cost optimization work, I recommend implementing scale-to-zero configurations wherever possible, right-sizing resource allocations through regular Azure Monitor analysis, and leveraging workload profiles efficiently. Organizations should maximize free tier usage during development and consider GPU workload patterns when choosing between serverless and dedicated GPU options."

The platform provides comprehensive integration with the Azure ecosystem through native support that works reliably without complex configuration.\nIdentity and access management includes built-in Azure Active Directory integration with Easy Auth for zero-code authentication supporting multiple identity providers. The managed identity support offers both system-assigned and user-assigned options for password-less access to Azure services. This eliminates the security risk and operational overhead of managing connection strings and API keys.\nDatabase integration spans the services I use most frequently in production deployments. Azure Cosmos DB supports NoSQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL APIs with seamless connectivity. Azure SQL Database works with managed identity authentication, eliminating connection string management. Azure Storage services integrate naturally for both structured and unstructured data requirements.\nKey Vault integration provides secure secret management with automatic retrieval using managed identities. This addresses one of the most common security anti-patterns I see - storing secrets in environment variables or configuration files. The integration works transparently, retrieving secrets at runtime without requiring application code changes.\nNetworking security features include Virtual Network integration, private endpoints through Azure Private Link, and peer-to-peer TLS encryption within environments. The compliance certifications include SOC 1/2/3, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and PCI DSS standards with built-in Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark compliance, addressing enterprise governance requirements I encounter regularly.\nCI/CD integration offers native support for Azure DevOps pipelines and GitHub Actions with automatic workflow generation.

These aren’t blockers, but they require planning and coordination.\nCommon challenges I help teams navigate include applications with Kubernetes API dependencies requiring refactoring, Helm chart incompatibility necessitating conversion to ACA deployment specifications, and custom monitoring solutions needing migration to Azure Monitor. These challenges are manageable with proper planning and staged approaches.\nThe developer experience improvements consistently impress teams making the transition. Reduced learning curves mean team members don’t need extensive Kubernetes knowledge, faster onboarding helps new team members contribute quickly, and the approximately 30% reduction in development time comes from eliminating infrastructure complexity.\nMigration success factors I’ve identified through experience include thorough dependency assessment before beginning the transition, gradual phased approaches that allow learning and adjustment, team training investment to build confidence with new tools, and proper observability establishment from deployment initiation to maintain visibility during the transition."

    "text": "Now let’s get practical. I want to walk you through deploying a real application that demonstrates Azure Container Apps capabilities in action. We’ll use the Beautiful Quotes App, which I built specifically to showcase modern web application patterns including dynamic content, API integration, and responsive design.\nThe complete source code and deployment instructions are available in my Azure Container Apps Demo repository, and I encourage you to follow along. If you prefer visual learning, check out my detailed video walkthrough where I demonstrate these concepts step by step.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\nThe Beautiful Quotes App represents a typical modern web application built with containerization principles. I chose this example because it demonstrates several important architectural patterns that translate well to enterprise scenarios.\nThe frontend consists of a single-page application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I made this choice deliberately to emphasize that Azure Container Apps works with any containerized application, regardless of technology stack. The application features dynamic background animations using HTML5 Canvas, theme customization, and social sharing capabilities representing common modern web application requirements.\nThe backend integration connects to the QuoteHub API for dynamic content, demonstrating how containerized applications typically consume external services. This pattern mirrors enterprise applications that integrate with multiple APIs, databases, and microservices in production environments.\nThe containerization strategy uses nginx Alpine as the base image, which I selected for its production-ready characteristics that minimize attack surface while providing excellent performance. The simple Dockerfile demonstrates best practices for static content serving that can be extended for more complex applications.\n\n\n\nLet’s start with the prerequisites. You’ll need Azure CLI with the Container Apps extension, which provides specialized commands for Container Apps management that aren’t available in the core Azure CLI. The extension handles the complexity of underlying Kubernetes operations while exposing simplified, developer-friendly commands.\n# Install the Container Apps extension with debug output for troubleshooting\naz extension add --name containerapp --debug\nI always recommend using the debug flag because it provides valuable troubleshooting information if installation encounters issues, particularly in corporate environments with proxy configurations.\nNext, we’ll establish your deployment context through authentication and subscription management. The device code flow works reliably across different environments, including cloud shells and restricted networks.\n# Authenticate using device code flow\naz login --use-device-code\n\n# Set your specific subscription context\naz account set --subscription \"&lt;your-subscription-id&gt;\"\nUnderstanding subscription context is crucial because Azure Container Apps resources are subscription-scoped, and pricing varies by region and subscription type.\n\n\n\nResource group creation establishes the logical container for all related resources. I’m using the Central India region for this demo, which demonstrates global availability while potentially offering cost advantages for certain workloads.\n# Create resource group in Central India region\naz group create --name quotes-app-rg --location centralindia\nResource groups provide lifecycle management, access control boundaries, and cost tracking capabilities. All our demo resources will be contained within this group for easy cleanup when we’re finished.\nProvider registration ensures the Azure subscription has access to required services. The OperationalInsights provider enables logging and monitoring capabilities that integrate with Container Apps environments.\n# Register the required provider for logging\naz provider register -n Microsoft.OperationalInsights --wait\nThe wait flag ensures the registration completes before proceeding, which is essential for subsequent commands that depend on these services.\nContainer Apps environment creation establishes the deployment boundary for your applications. Environments provide shared infrastructure including networking, logging, and scaling capabilities.\n# Create the Container Apps environment\naz containerapp env create --name quotes-app-env --resource-group quotes-app-rg --location centralindia\nEnvironments abstract away underlying Kubernetes complexity while providing enterprise features like Virtual Network integration, private endpoints, and workload profiles. Multiple applications can share a single environment, optimizing costs through resource sharing.\n\n\n\nThe basic deployment demonstrates core Container Apps functionality with minimal configuration complexity.\n# Deploy with basic configuration\naz containerapp create \\\n  --name beautiful-quotes-app \\\n  --resource-group quotes-app-rg \\\n  --environment quotes-app-env \\\n  --image kunalondock/beautiful-quotes-app:v1 \\\n  --target-port 80 \\\n  --ingress external \\\n  --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn\nThis command creates a Container App with external ingress, meaning it’s accessible from the internet. The target-port 80 specification matches the nginx configuration in the Dockerfile. The query parameter extracts the fully qualified domain name for immediate access to your deployed application.\nThe deployment uses the pre-built container image from Docker Hub, eliminating the need for local Docker builds during initial testing. This pattern accelerates development workflows and simplifies CI/CD pipeline integration.\n\n\n\nNow let’s explore Azure Container Apps’ sophisticated scaling capabilities that distinguish it from traditional hosting solutions.\n# Deploy with auto-scaling configuration\naz containerapp create \\\n  --name beautiful-quotes-app \\\n  --resource-group quotes-app-rg \\\n  --environment quotes-app-env \\\n  --image kunalondock/beautiful-quotes-app:v1 \\\n  --min-replicas 0 \\\n  --max-replicas 5 \\\n  --scale-rule-name azure-http-rule \\\n  --scale-rule-type http \\\n  --scale-rule-http-concurrency 3 \\\n  --target-port 80 \\\n  --ingress external \\\n  --query properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn\nThe scale-to-zero configuration represents a fundamental shift from traditional hosting models. When no requests are active, the application consumes zero compute resources and incurs no charges. This capability alone can reduce hosting costs by 60% to 80% for applications with variable traffic patterns.\nThe HTTP-based scaling rule with concurrency setting of 3 means new instances launch when existing instances handle more than three concurrent requests. This setting balances responsiveness with resource efficiency. Lower concurrency values provide better performance but higher costs, while higher values optimize costs but may impact response times.\nThe maximum replica limit of 5 provides cost protection while allowing substantial traffic handling. Each replica can handle the configured concurrency, so this configuration supports 15 concurrent requests maximum before queuing occurs.\n\n\n\nLog analysis provides insights into application behavior and performance characteristics that help you understand how your application performs in production.\n# View application logs for troubleshooting\naz containerapp logs show --name beautiful-quotes-app --resource-group quotes-app-rg\nContainer Apps automatically aggregates logs from all replicas, providing unified visibility into application behavior. Logs include both application output and platform events like scaling decisions, making troubleshooting significantly easier than traditional container platforms.\nMonitoring integration occurs automatically through Azure Monitor, providing metrics for CPU utilization, memory consumption, request counts, and response times. This observability comes without additional configuration, which represents a significant advantage over self-managed container platforms.\n\n\n\nLocal development begins with the provided source code from my Azure Container Apps Demo repository, allowing complete customization of functionality, styling, and behavior.\n# Build your custom version locally\ndocker build -t your-username/quotes-app:v1 .\n\n# Test locally before deployment\ndocker run -d -p 8080:80 your-username/quotes-app:v1\nThe Dockerfile optimization uses nginx Alpine for minimal footprint and maximum security. The multi-stage build pattern can be extended for applications requiring compilation steps, asset processing, or dependency installation.\nContainer registry publishing enables deployment from your customized image.\n# Publish to Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry\ndocker login\ndocker push your-username/quotes-app:v1\nProduction considerations include implementing health checks, configuring startup probes for complex initialization sequences, and establishing proper logging patterns for observability in production environments.\n\n\n\nThis demo deployment demonstrates cost optimization principles that apply to production workloads. The scale-to-zero configuration means the application costs nothing during inactive periods. During active periods, costs remain minimal due to efficient resource utilization.\nFree tier usage covers substantial testing and development workloads. The 180,000 vCPU-seconds monthly allowance supports approximately fifty hours of continuous single-vCPU operation, while the 2 million request allowance accommodates significant development activity without incurring charges.\nProduction scaling from this demo foundation requires analyzing traffic patterns, adjusting concurrency settings, and potentially implementing more sophisticated scaling rules based on queue depth, database connections, or custom metrics that reflect your specific application requirements."

    "text": "Continuous Integration :\nSo for the example let’s think that we have two synapse workspace which represents two environments.\n\nNow log into the dev synapse workspace by going to the portal and clicking on the open synapse studio dialog box\n\nOnce you are in dev synapse studio go to Settings and then GIT configuration.\n\nthen click on ‘configure’\n\nselect GITHUB or AZURE DEVOPS in the repository type\n\nThen proceed to select the collaboration branch and publish branch.\n\nThe collaboration branch and publish branch are two crucial ideas in Synapse Studio that are connected to source control and versioning of Synapse artifacts.\nThe collaboration branch where numerous developers can work together on a Single workspace is the collaboration branch. Usually, Synapse artifacts are developed, tested, and validated using this branch. The collaboration branch can be updated by developers after they create and modify Synapse items like pipelines, notebooks, data flows, and SQL scripts. When you establish a new workspace in Synapse Studio, the collaboration branch, which is the default branch, is automatically created.\nThe publish branch however does a different thing, it publishes the ARM template into that branch which contains everything in the artifact be it pipelines, notebooks, and Linked services detail everything!\nOnce you are done it will look something like this,\n\nNow try to commit all and then publish\n\nThis will start generating the ARM templates and save them in the repo mentioned.\nIf you go to the repo you will see a folder showing your synapse workspace name which will contain two ARM templates.\n\nthe build and release concept is kind of this.\n\nSo we are using three branch policy\nDevelop branch: This branch would be the primary branch for developers to work on Synapse artifacts, including pipelines, notebooks, and data flows. Each developer would create their own feature branch from the develop branch, where they would make and commit their changes. When their feature is complete and tested, they would submit a pull request to merge their changes into the develop branch. The development branch would contain the latest tested changes from all the feature branches.\nFeature branch: Each developer would create their own feature branch from the develop branch, where they would make and commit their changes. Feature branches are typically named after the feature or issue that they are addressing. Once a developer has completed their changes and testing, they would submit a pull request to merge their changes into the develop branch.\nMain branch: The main branch would be the publish branch where you would deploy your Synapse artifacts to a live environment. The main branch would only contain the latest, tested changes that have been approved and merged from the develop branch.\nIn this setup, developers would use the develop branch to collaborate and integrate their changes before publishing to the main branch. This enables developers to work in parallel while maintaining a single source of truth for the Synapse artifacts. The use of feature branches ensures that changes are isolated and tested before being integrated into the develop branch. Finally, the main branch would contain only the tested and approved changes that are ready for deployment. By using this branch policy, you can help ensure that changes to your Synapse artifacts are properly tested and validated, and that version control is maintained throughout the development process.\nCreate a pipeline with the below code\n# The pipeline copies files from workspace publish branch and publishes artifact\n# @author  Kunal Das\n# @version 1.0\n# @since   10-11-2022\nname: \n    -synapse-CI-low\ntrigger:\n- workspace_publish\n\npool:\n  vmImage: ubuntu-22.04\n\nsteps:\n\n- task: CopyFiles@2\n  displayName: 'Copy Files to Build Pipeline directory'\n  inputs:\n    SourceFolder: 'synapse-dev'\n    TargetFolder: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/ARM'\n\n- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1\n  displayName: 'Publish Pipeline Artifact'\n  inputs:\n    targetPath: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'\n    artifact: drop\nThis is a simplified YAML pipeline for Synapse CI/CD that has been named ‘synapse-CI-low’. The pipeline triggers whenever a Synapse workspace is published. The pipeline runs on an Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine.\nThe first step in the pipeline is to copy files from a folder called ‘synapse-dev’ to a directory called ‘ARM’ in the build pipeline. This step is accomplished using the ‘CopyFiles’ task.\nThe second and final step in the pipeline is to publish the Synapse artifacts as a pipeline artifacts. This step is accomplished using the ‘PublishPipelineArtifact’ task. The target path for the artifacts is set to the build artifact staging directory, and the artifact is named ‘drop’.\nThis pipeline is a simple example of a Synapse CI/CD pipeline that copies Synapse artifacts from a source directory and publishes them as a pipeline artifact. This pipeline can be further expanded to include additional steps for building, testing, and deploying the Synapse artifacts.\nNow to deploy the ARM template one extension is required, which can be added from the marketplace.\nTo install the extension follow these steps:\n\nLog in to your Azure DevOps organization and navigate to the Extensions tab in the left-hand menu.\nClick on Browse Marketplace to access the Visual Studio Marketplace.\nSearch for the extension you want to install by typing the name of the extension in the search bar.\nClick on the extension from the list of results to open the extension page.\nClick on the Get it free button.\nSelect the Azure DevOps organization where you want to install the extension and review the terms and conditions.\nClick on the Install button to install the extension in your Azure DevOps organization.\n\nNow for release, we need to add the main step:\nwhich is workspace deployment, for that we add the below task\nsteps:\n- task: AzureSynapseWorkspace.synapsecicd-deploy.synapse-deploy.Synapse workspace deployment@2\n  displayName: 'Synpase deployment task for workspace: synapse-qa'\n  inputs:\n    TemplateFile: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_Synapse-CI-pipeline/drop/ARM/TemplateForWorkspace.json'\n    ParametersFile: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_Synapse-CI-pipeline/drop/ARM/TemplateParametersForWorkspace.json'\n    azureSubscription: 'syn-sp'\n    ResourceGroupName: 'synapseQA-RG'\n    TargetWorkspaceName: 'synapse-qa'\n    OverrideArmParameters: '-LS_AKV_QA_properties_typeProperties_baseUrl https://synapse-qa.vault.azure.net/'\n    FailOnMissingOverrides: true\nThis is a YAML code snippet for deploying a Synapse workspace using the Synapse Workspace Deployment task in Azure DevOps. The code contains the following steps:\n\nThe task is defined with the name ‘Synapse deployment task for workspace: synapse-qa’ and the version number of the Synapse Workspace Deployment task is set to 2.\nThe template and parameter files for the Synapse workspace are specified. The template file is named ‘TemplateForWorkspace.json’ and the parameters file is named ‘TemplateParametersForWorkspace.json’. These files are located in the default working directory of the pipeline.\nThe Azure subscription to be used for the deployment is specified as ‘syn-sp’.\nThe resource group name where the Synapse workspace will be deployed is set to ‘synapseQA-RG’.\nThe target Synapse workspace name is set to ‘synapse-qa’.\nThe override ARM parameters are specified using the parameter name and the new value. In this case, the parameter name is ‘-LS_AKV_QA_properties_typeProperties_baseUrl’ and the new value is ‘https://synapse-qa.vault.azure.net/’.\nThe ‘FailOnMissingOverrides’ option is set to true, which means that the deployment will fail if any of the specified override parameters are not found.\n\nIn summary, this code snippet deploys a Synapse workspace to the specified Azure subscription, resource group, and Synapse workspace name. The override ARM parameters allow you to customize the deployment settings for the workspace.\nif you notice when we deploy the ARM template we need to change somethings like\n1 . Sql pool name\n2. Linked Services details\n3. Spark pool name\nIf you have the same name for all these then you may not have to tinker with the ARM template but for others before running the above deployment step we need to modify these.\nsteps:\n- task: PythonScript@0\n  displayName: 'Change SQL Pool'\n  inputs:\n    scriptSource: inline\n    script: |\n     search_text = 'synapsesqlpooldev'\n     replace_text = 'synapsesqlpoolqa'\n     \n     with open(r'$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_Synapse-CI-pipeline/drop/ARM/TemplateForWorkspace.json', 'r') as file:\n        data = file.read()\n        data = data.replace(search_text, replace_text)\n     with open(r'$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_Synapse-CI-pipeline/drop/ARM/TemplateForWorkspace.json', 'w') as file:\n        file.write(data)\n     print(\"SQL pool changed\")\n     \nThis is a YAML code snippet for a PythonScript task in Azure DevOps. The task changes the name of a SQL pool in an ARM template file for a Synapse workspace deployment. The code contains the following steps:\n\nThe task is defined with the name ‘Change SQL Pool’ and the task version is set to 0.\nThe script source is set to ‘inline’, which means that the script is written in the YAML file directly.\nThe Python script is defined, which replaces the search text ‘synapsesqlpooldev’ with the replacement text ‘synapsesqlpoolqa’ in the ARM template file.\nThe ARM template file is read and its contents are stored in the ‘data’ variable.\nThe ‘replace’ method is used to replace the search text with the replacement text.\nThe modified data is written back to the ARM template file.\nA message ‘SQL pool changed’ is printed to the console.\n\nIn summary, this code snippet uses a Python script to modify the ARM template file for a Synapse workspace deployment by changing the name of a SQL pool from ‘synapsesqlpooldev’ to ‘synapsesqlpoolqa’. The modified ARM template file is used in the subsequent tasks for deploying the Synapse workspace.\nThe same kind of scripts can use for Spark pool and linked services as well.\nIf you want to use Powershell here is the command\nLet us change the linked Azure KeyVault for the same.\n(Get-Content -path $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_Synapse-CI-pipeline/drop/ARM/TemplateForWorkspace.json) -replace 'LS_AKV_DEV','LS_AKV_QA' | Set-Content -Path $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_Synapse-CI-pipeline/drop/ARM/TemplateForWorkspace.json\n\n\n(Get-Content -path $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_Synapse-CI-pipeline/drop/ARM/TemplateParametersForWorkspace.json) -replace 'LS_AKV_DEV','LS_AKV_QA' | Set-Content -Path $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_Synapse-CI-pipeline/drop/ARM/TemplateParametersForWorkspace.json\n\nThe first command replaces the string ‘LS_AKV_DEV’ with ‘LS_AKV_QA’ in the contents of the ARM template file named ‘TemplateForWorkspace.json’.\nThe second command replaces the same string in the contents of the ARM template parameter file named ‘TemplateParametersForWorkspace.json’.\nThe ‘-path’ parameter specifies the file path for each file, which is set to the default working directory in the build pipeline.\nThe ‘-replace’ parameter is used to search for the specified string and replace it with the replacement string in each file.\nThe ‘|’ (pipe) character is used to send the modified contents to the ‘Set-Content’ command, which writes the modified contents back to the same file.\nThe modified ARM template files are used in the subsequent tasks for deploying the Synapse workspace.\n\nIn summary, this PowerShell script code uses the ‘Get-Content’ and ‘Set-Content’ commands to modify the contents of two ARM template files for a Synapse workspace deployment in Azure DevOps. The ‘replace’ parameter is used to replace a string in each file, and the modified files are used in the subsequent deployment tasks.\nNow if you have some triggers in the synapse workspace it will not deploy as before deployment triggers must be turned off, to achieve this we can add the below task just before deployment\nsteps:\n- task: AzureSynapseWorkspace.synapsecicd-deploy.toggle-trigger.toggle-triggers-dev@2\n  displayName: 'Toggle Azure Synapse Triggers'\n  inputs:\n    azureSubscription: 'syn-sp'\n    ResourceGroupName: 'Synapseqa-RG'\n    WorkspaceName: 'synapse-qa'\n    ToggleOn: false\nThis pipeline step uses the Azure Synapse CI/CD extension to turn off triggers for a Synapse workspace. The task is named “Toggle Azure Synapse Triggers” and the version being used is 2. The task has several inputs including:\n\nazureSubscription: The Azure subscription that contains the Synapse workspace.\nResourceGroupName: The name of the resource group where the Synapse workspace is located.\nWorkspaceName: The name of the Synapse workspace where the triggers will be turned off.\nToggleOn: A boolean value indicating whether to turn on or off the Synapse triggers. In this case, it is set to false, meaning the triggers will be turned off.\n\nOnce you do all these steps you are finally ready to deploy the synapse workspace!!!"

At this point if you click on the Connections side pane on the left you will definitely see the connection sub menu there,\n\nNow select the server connection from here and then right-click and select ’create project from database’ option,\n\nKeep the settings as shown in the below image but select the folder and project name appropriately.\n\n\nOnce you are done with it you will see a project from the left side pane\n\n\n\nNow the only step is to add the project to the Azure repo, there are plenty of ways we can do that, but here inside Azure Data studio itself, you can do the same by going into the left pane source control option.\nClick on the three-dot menu and then select the add remote option,\n\n\n\nHere u just have to put the azure repo link, if it fails somehow open the terminal by pressing “ctrl + `” and then run the git init command which will initialize the directory,\nOnce u put the azure repo link whatever changes are there in your project can be pushed to the azure repo easily.\nVerify the remote repo by the command ‘git remote -v’\nThe Sync option can also be used as it will automatically pull and then push the repo from the azure repo to the local system,\n\n\nOpen the azure repo and navigate to your repo and see the files updated,\n\nNow we have to create a build pipeline for that,\ngo to pipeline and a new pipeline,\n\nselect Azure repo and locate your repository.\n\n\nThe third step would be just selecting the starter pipeline option.\n\n\n\nThen in the yaml file paste the below code,\n\n# @Author : Kunal Das\n# Date : 30-12-2022\n\n\nvariables:\n  poolstagingarea: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)\\poolstaging\n  BuildConfiguration: release\n  SQLPoolartifactname: AzureSQLPool\n  SQLPooldacpacfile: $(System.ArtifactsDirectory)\\$(SQLPoolartifactname)\\synapseSQLpoolDEV.sqlproj\n\n\ntrigger:\n- main\n\n\npool:\n  vmImage: windows-2019\n\n\nstages:\n\n\n- stage: Pooldacpac\n  displayName: 'Build dacpac'\n\n\n  jobs:\n    - job: 'Builddacpac'\n      displayName: 'Build SQL Pool dacpac'\n      \n      steps:\n      - task: VSBuild@1\n        displayName: 'Builds the dacpac'\n        inputs:\n          solution: synapseSQLpoolDEV.sqlproj\n          configuration: $(BuildConfiguration)\n\n\n      - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1\n        displayName: 'Publishes dacpac as an artifact'\n        # Publishes the dacpac as part of an artifact within Azure DevOps\n        inputs:\n          PathtoPublish: 'bin\\$(BuildConfiguration)'\n          ArtifactName: $(SQLPoolartifactname)\n          publishLocation: 'Container'\n\nAnd Done! The build pipeline is ready, you may notice I have given the main branch as a trigger at the top so every time someone updates the main branch it triggers the main pipeline.\nSave and run the pipeline, you can see all jobs running perfectly!!!\n\n\n\nClick on the pipeline and see the job artifact in this case the dacpac file has been published."

    "text": "image\nHey there, Almost everyone who deploys python code wants to have it thoroughly checked and follow proper standards but sometimes setting up a code quality pipeline in your CI-CD process can be cumbersome due to various reasons.\nMainly, 1. You have to setup for each individual pipelines which can be an issue since many of us might have multiple repo multiple project and we need to have it standardize across projects to make sure it just works without tinkering in every other repo 2. There are plenty of tools and finding the right set of tools and also making sure a certain set of tools work together without giving any issues 3. Publishing a output also matters which will help the developers easily see what is lacking and they can start improving on the same.\nPython developers and DevOps enthusiasts! Today, we’re going to walk through setting up a robust build validation pipeline for your Python projects using Azure DevOps. This guide will help you ensure code quality, maintain consistency across multiple repositories, and streamline your development process - all without relying on external tools.\nI was tasked not long ago to find a FREE solution without any external tool which should have below features\nWhile I started developing the build validation pipeline ( Azure DevOps term basically means successful run of a pipeline to merge the pull request to a particular branch) I started looking for coding standards mainly for python I stumbled upon many articles and was in a bit of confusion which one to follow, but respecting the popularity and unanimous use of PEP-8 made the decision much easier.\nRef :https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/\nOk on top of a pep-8 validator I thought of adding isort which is another great tool to validate if your imports are correctly sorted and on top of this I added a few things extra like BLACK if we look at the black defination we see\nRef : https://pypi.org/project/black/\nSo from code quality part I ended up using three tools or validators 1. Black (code formatter) 2. isort (import sorter) 3. Flake8 (linter)\nI also added pytest and code coverage checks on this pipeline just to make sure developers are diligent to write unit test cases before they push the code to main branch\nThe steps here are for Azure Devops Pipeline but it can be easily replicated to githuba ctions or any other ci-cd tools with very minimal to minor tweaking\nSo let’s look at the pipeline that I have been telling till now"

    "section": "Step-by-Step Setup",
    "text": "Step-by-Step Setup\n\nStep 1: Create the Azure Pipeline YAML File\nFirst, create a file named azure-pipelines.yml in the root of your repository. This file will define our pipeline.\ntrigger:\n  - none\n\nvariables:\n  - name: sourcePath\n    value: 'sourcecode'\n  - name: coverageThreshold\n    value: 80\n  - group: Tokens\n  - name: CodeDirectory\n    value: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)'\n\npool:\n  vmimage: 'ubuntu-latest'\n\njobs:\n- job: BuildTestAndAnalyze\n  displayName: '🚀 Build, Test, and Analyze'\n  steps:\n  - task: UsePythonVersion@0\n    inputs:\n      versionSpec: '3.9'\n    displayName: '🐍 Use Python 3.9'\n\n  # More steps will be added here\nThis sets up the basic structure of our pipeline, specifying the Python version and defining some variables we’ll use later.\nNow if you see ths issue we need this build validation pipeline in multiple repositories which is a bit tricky since we all know if we add this yaml to a particular repo then it will only work on that and not any other repo instead I wanted it to be a seperate but clone the repo for which it get's triggered in the pull request.\n\nThe solution? \nlook at he below step :)\n\n\nStep 2: Clone the PR Repository\nAdd this step to clone the PR repository:\n  - bash: |\n      echo \"🚀 Initiating repository clone process...\"\n      REPO_URL=$(System.PullRequest.SourceRepositoryURI)\n      AUTH_URL=$(echo $REPO_URL | sed \"s|cyncly-engineering@|$(Code_Read_PAT)@|\")\n      FULL_BRANCH=$(System.PullRequest.SourceBranch)\n      BRANCH=$(echo $FULL_BRANCH | sed 's|^refs/heads/||')\n      CLONE_DIR=$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/cloned_repo\n      \n      git clone --branch \"$BRANCH\" \"$AUTH_URL\" \"$CLONE_DIR\"\n      \n      if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        echo \"✅ Git clone successful\"\n        echo \"##vso[task.setvariable variable=CodeDirectory]$CLONE_DIR\"\n      else\n        echo \"❌ Git clone failed\"\n        exit 1\n      fi\n    displayName: '🔄 Clone PR Repository'\nThis step clones the PR repository, allowing us to work with the latest code.\nthis is a bit tricky spart and for other ci-cd tool we need to modify this the most\n\n\nStep 3: Install Dependencies\nNext, let’s install the project dependencies and our code quality tools:\n  - script: |\n      echo \"🔧 Setting up Python environment...\"\n      python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n      if [ -f $(sourcePath)/requirements.txt ]; then\n        pip install -r $(sourcePath)/requirements.txt\n      fi\n    workingDirectory: $(CodeDirectory)\n    displayName: '📦 Install Project Dependencies'\n\n  - script: |\n      echo \"🛠️ Installing code quality and testing tools...\"\n      pip install black flake8 isort pytest pytest-cov httpx\n    displayName: '🛠️ Install Code Quality and Testing Tools'\n\n\nStep 4: Run Code Quality Checks\nNow, let’s add steps to run our code quality checks:\n  - script: |\n      echo \"🖌️ Running Black formatter check...\"\n      black --check --line-length 79 $(sourcePath) \n    displayName: '🖌️ Run Black'\n    workingDirectory: $(CodeDirectory)\n\n  - script: |\n      echo \"🔀 Running isort import sorter check...\"\n      isort --check-only $(sourcePath)\n    displayName: '🔀 Run isort'\n    workingDirectory: $(CodeDirectory)\n\n  - script: |\n      echo \"🔍 Running Flake8 linter...\"\n      flake8 $(sourcePath)\n    displayName: '🔍 Run Flake8'\n    workingDirectory: $(CodeDirectory)\nThese steps will check your code formatting, import sorting, and linting.\n\n\nStep 5: Run Tests and Generate Coverage Report\nAdd this step to run tests and generate a coverage report:\n  - script: |\n      echo \"🧪 Running unit tests and generating coverage report...\"\n      pytest --cov=$(sourcePath) --cov-report=xml --cov-report=html ./tests\n    displayName: '🧪 Run Tests with pytest'\n    workingDirectory: $(CodeDirectory)\n\n\nStep 6: Check Code Coverage Threshold\nLet’s ensure our code meets a minimum coverage threshold:\n  - script: |\n      echo \"📊 Checking code coverage threshold...\"\n      coverage_percentage=$(python -c \"import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET; tree = ET.parse('coverage.xml'); root = tree.getroot(); print(float(root.attrib['line-rate']) * 100)\")\n      echo \"Current code coverage: $coverage_percentage%\"\n      echo \"Coverage threshold: $COVERAGE_THRESHOLD%\"\n      if (( $(echo \"$coverage_percentage &lt; $COVERAGE_THRESHOLD\" | bc -l) )); then\n        echo \"❌ ##vso[task.logissue type=error]Code coverage ($coverage_percentage%) is below the threshold of $COVERAGE_THRESHOLD%\"\n        exit 1\n      else\n        echo \"✅ Code coverage ($coverage_percentage%) meets or exceeds the threshold of $COVERAGE_THRESHOLD%\"\n      fi\n    displayName: '📊 Check Code Coverage Threshold'\n    workingDirectory: $(CodeDirectory)\n    env:\n      COVERAGE_THRESHOLD: $(coverageThreshold)\n\n\nStep 7: Publish Coverage Report\nFinally, let’s publish our coverage report:\n  - task: PublishCodeCoverageResults@1\n    inputs:\n      codeCoverageTool: 'cobertura'\n      summaryFileLocation: '$(CodeDirectory)/coverage.xml'\n      reportDirectory: '$(CodeDirectory)/htmlcov'\n    displayName: '📈 Publish Coverage Report'\n\n  - publish: $(CodeDirectory)/htmlcov\n    artifact: CodeCoverageReport\n    displayName: '📦 Publish Coverage Report as Artifact'"
