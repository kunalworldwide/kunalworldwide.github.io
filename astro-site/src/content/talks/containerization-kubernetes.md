Kubernetes has democratized the deployment and management of containerized applications, making it accessible even at smaller scales with minimal complexity. However, scaling Kubernetes to manage millions of workloads introduces a new set of challenges that go far beyond the capabilities of basic Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA). This presentation explores advanced strategies for scaling Kubernetes efficiently and effectively while maintaining a keen eye on cost optimization.
